# Todoist Analytics

The main goal for this tool is to help you visualize, analyze and get insights about your todoist tasks.

I always wanted to have something like this in todoist or with an integration, but I couldn't find any good solutions. 
After a while I found [this project](https://github.com/brunorosilva/todoist-analytics) from Bruno Chicelli,
that finally satisfied my curiosity. However, I wanted more features, and I wanted to make it my own.
So I decided to build starting from his ideas and code to include some additional things I always wanted to have.

## Pending tasks

- [X] Simplify code and remove tools that I don't use
- [ ] Instructions for running this tool locally
- [ ] Instructions for running this tool using docker
- [ ] Deploy it to a server (and create pipeline) so others can use the most recent version

## Ideas of new features

- [ ] New habit reports (Weekly, Monthly and Yearly)
- [ ] Kanban-like metrics (throughput, velocity, etc)
- [ ] Balance of effort in projects (plan vs actual)
- [ ] Focus view (recommendations of tasks to focus on)
